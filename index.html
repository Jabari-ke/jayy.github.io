Decided to delv deeper into it with the course IT. I later developed interest in understanding how technology can be improved and made better by the help of technoloogy and cybersecurity. I have a keen eye for problem-solving and try my best to make complicated tasks easy to understand. Working with others is my forte.</p><p> I have been delving deeper into the inner workings of both Windows and Linux operating systems, and understanding how they work. I also have been exploring the world of cybersecurity and my dive into penetration testing and red teaming continues to get deeper day by day. My skills in these areas are at a beginner level, but I'm making my way up towards the intermediate stage. I'm always on a learning journey, eager to acquire knowledge and enhance my skills.</p><p>Goals: I want to be part of projects that use cybersecurity and technology to solve real-world problems. I'm eager to learn new things and keep up with the latest technology trends. I want to use my skills to make a real impact and help shape the future of the cyberspace and technology.</p></section> <section id="education"> <h2>Education</h2> <div class="level"> <h3>University</h3> <p>The Technical University of Kenya</p><p>Years: 2021 - Present</p><p>Course: (Undergraduate) Bachelor's in IT</p><p>Qualities earned : Hardwork, Team-work, Hands on skills</p></div><div class="level"> <h3>Secondary School</h3> <p>Sunshine Secondary School</p><p>Years: 2017 - 2021</p><p>Qualities earned : Patience, Resilience</p></div><div class="level"> <h3>Primary School</h3> <p>Cedar Progressive Academy</p><p>Years: 2008 - 2016</p><p>Qualities earned : God-fearing, Discipline</p></div></section> <section id="skills"> <h2>Skills</h2> <h3>Soft Skills:</h3> <ul> <li>Communication</li><li>Teamwork</li><li>Problem Solving</li><li>Adaptability</li><li>Continuous learning</li></ul> <h3>Hard Skills:</h3> <ul> <li>Programming (e.g., Java, Python)</li><li>Web Development - frontend and backend</li><li>Networking - Network models and Security</li><li>Android App Development (Java)</li><li>Cybersecurity and Red Team Penetration Testing (Beginner to Intermediate Level)</li><li>Familiarity and use of both linux and windows operating system</li><li>Proficient in using various cybersecurity tools and platforms</li><li>Capture the flag competitions</li><li>Familiarity with Network Security and Encryption</li></ul> </section> <section id="additional-info"> <h2>Additional Information</h2> <p>Awards - <a href="https://twitter.com/kcsfa/status/1684083944554373120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#hackathon </a> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p><p>Workshops - Attended training workshop on education and teaching at my local Church</p><p>Leadership training - attended a student Leadership training in highschool </p><p> Hobbies : Playing the Guitar, Swimming, Singing</p></section> <section id="referees"> <h2>Referees</h2> <div class="referee"> <h3>Reference 1</h3> <p>Name: Mr George Omiso</p><p>Phone: <a href="tel:+254724153559">(+254) 7241 535 59</a></p></div><div class="referee"> <h3>Reference 2</h3> <p>Name: Miss Margaret Moraa</p><p>Phone: <a href="tel:+254729258493">(+254) 7292 584 93</a></p></div></section> </main> <a href="https://wa.me/+254102254212" class="whatsapp-button" target="_blank"></a></body><footer> <div class="learning-adapting"> <p>Jeremiah Nyandoro Onsando - Forever Learning and Adapting</p></div><div class="back-to-top"> <a href="#top">Back to the Top</a> </div></footer></html>
